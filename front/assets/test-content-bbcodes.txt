[centre][b][color=red]Operator Thogar - Mythic[/color] [color=yellow](6/7M HM, 7/10M BRF)[/color][/b]

This was a pretty fun encounter to progress on, despite having raids without any Druids or Warlocks at times. We had a very tight 1% wipe last reset but had crappy set-ups available since, due to exams and various holidays. We had a proper set-up tonight and defeated the encounter with at least 0.1 seconds to spare! (on an attempt where 2 different DPS disconnected during the pull).

This encounter is pretty straightforward; although the design of the Mythic-only phase is a bit short-sighted given the difficulty of that portion varies wildly with set-up. We had a very weak set-up for that particular part so had to spend a fair chunk of time getting that bit consistent. The boss died very quickly after, along with some unimportant mage who our healers blacklisted from their healing frames some time ago.

We killed Gruul and then Flamebender Ka'graz this reset. Not much to say about either boss besides 'we made them a lot more difficult than they should have been ...'

For us Blackrock Foundry had a very disappointing launch since we encountered a number of server issues, where e.g. ~15 our raiders characters were locked offline until 23:00 meaning we couldn't even raid some nights. Meanwhile other guilds on our realm encountered no such issues. Having a fairly short schedule we've found ourselves playing a bit of catch-up since then but we're starting to make steady progress now again. We killed the first 3 bosses in this order: Oregorger, Beastlord Darmac and Hans+Franz although we should have killed Darmac first since that encounter was an absolute joke in comparison to the others (although admittedly we had a lot of wasted time on Oregorger due to disconnects and other issues - like having [dr]Zangetsú[/dr] in the raid).

A straight-up DPS check. Should be straightforward right? Not with our Wheelchair General - Liquidate and Rallying Wipe Lieutenant - Spankanoid in the raid!

The Mythic-only changes to this encounter are not particularly difficult in isolation but when coupled with all of the other mechanics we found this one a pretty decent challenge. It's the type of fight that's likely to get drastically easier quickly with a bit more gear though.

Not much to say about this one. Survivability, movement and minor DPS check featuring 2 fat bastards (and I'm not talking about [dr]Drupép[/dr] and [dr]Rathy[/dr]! ).

As the first Mythic encounter of the Tier, this one is very straightforward and should in theory only take a few pulls at most - if it weren't for the Plethora of bugs we encountered - coupled with various server stability issues. It died the first night we went there but took far too long. The kill happened as tradition dictates on one of the messiest pulls of the evening :)

'Start as you mean to go on' we say!
